# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
Create a logistic regression model to give each lead a lead score between 0 and 100 that the business can use to target potential leads. In contrast, a lower score would indicate that the lead is cold and unlikely to convert, while a higher score would indicate that the lead is hot and most likely to convert.
